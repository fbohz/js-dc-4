##### Idea 1 - Food Truck App
Food truck aggregator and follower by twitter feed and geolocate on map. Food truck gets added by inputing twiter handle. 

##### Idea 2 - Short-Films Feed
Provide daily short films by connecting to youtube on most played ones. Shortfilms can be added also by url. Shortfilms can be rated by clicking on stars.

	Make a wheel that you can rotate based upon short film genre.
	When you rotate the wheel it will spit a short film you can watch based upon genre.
	It will use Youtube API to spit out short-films based on genres
	After you watch you can share and like/unlike.

##### Idea 3
I only have 2 so far. If I get one by Monday I will add it accordingly
